# The script in this directory was used to compute Bayes factor reflecting each geneâ€™s strength for ASD association from functional annotations 
# We considered two representation forms of annotations: 
# (1) binary: presence/absence in biological processes previously implicated in ASD  
# (2) continuous: gene-level metrics (e.g., pLi) 
# We used empirical bayes model and estimated the hyperparameters using methods of moments (please see the paper for details)
