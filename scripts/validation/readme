# validation
# 1) genes identified in sequencing study in 2020

# e.g.
Rscript asd2020_120920.r --list 2016krishnan.test.fmt.txt

# 2) genes from SFARI database

# e.g.
Rscript /home/jiy1/ASD/ASD_paper/final/sfari_enrich_121020.r --list 2016krishnan.test.fmt.txt

# 3) LDSC using GWAS
# the idea is to first construct annotation near genes of interest, and use LDSC to compute the enrichment of GWAS heritability in these annotations
# please see LDSC tutorial for details (https://github.com/bulik/ldsc/wiki/Partitioned-Heritability)
